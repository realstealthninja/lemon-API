# lemonAPI
Small part of larger API. Gives random fact related to lemons. The larger API is not yet published.

## Usage
**This project is built to run in docker, basically only because of PostgreSQL**
You may connect to your own postgresql host by modifying `./lemonapi/utils/config.py` ``Server`` class.

## Credentials
There are no default testing credentials, you must create user yourself. It is done easily in the `/docs/` endpoint, security section --> `add_user`.

### Docker usage
Project has `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` pre made.
1) clone repo
2) in terminal type `docker compose up --build` to run and build or `docker compose build` to only build image
3) API should be running

### Using the API

The API should be running at `http://localhost:5001` check `http://localhost:5001/docs` to view endpoints.

## How to make a request to get API token?
Most of functionality can be tested alone in the `/docs` endpoint, but you may as well interact with code.
This example will give you access to authorization token used to authenticate your request to endpoints requiring OAuth2.
```py
import requests

data = {"username": "exampleusername", "password": "coolpassword"}  # example data

resp = session.post(
    "http://localhost:5001/token", data=data
)  # request to the server to get token

token = resp.json()["access_token"]  # get the token from the response
print("access token", token)  # printing the access token
```
### Using the API token
Using the variable `token` from example above. The endpoint `/lemon/verbs` uses OAuth2, so you must pass an Authorization token.
```py
import requests

foo = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:5001/lemon/verbs", headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
)
print(foo.status_code)  # You should be granted with response status 200
```
That's it, you should be able to get started with the basics
## Errors

If you find a bug or error, open an issue and give a required information such as function/line where it happens in at, what is wrong and possibly other information (optional)

Want to know more about the API? Open an issue with label **question** or DM me in discord or something idk.
