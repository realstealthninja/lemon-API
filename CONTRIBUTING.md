## How to run the project

### Prerequisites
This project is built to be run with `docker` and `docker-compose` due to relying on services such as postgres, grafana and prometheus. How ever, it is possible to run the project without docker, but you will have to have postgres, grafana and prometheus hosts. There is no current documentation of how to configure promethues or grafana.

Project has `requirements.txt` for dependencies related to the project and `requirements-dev.txt` for development dependencies. You can install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` respectively.

### Running backend with docker
1. Clone the repository
2. Move into the project directory
3. Create a new file to the root of project called `.env` and copy content of `.env-template` in there. You can  leave the database variables as they are if you wish to. In which case the database username will be `admin`, the password will be `admin` and database name will be set to `lemonapi`
4. Run `docker compose up --build` to build and run the project.
5. You should now be able access the api at `http://localhost:5001/docs` or `http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs`
6. You can shutdown the container by running `docker compose stop`

### Accessing metrics
Metrics services when ran locally are located in:
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

Login to grafana with credentils `admin:pass@123`. Follow the pictures in `metrics/images` for general idea of how to set it up.

This project comes with pre-made grafana dashboard that you can find in metrics/dashboard.json. There are some images in metrics/images on how to start the dashboard and how to configure it correctly.

### Credentials
There are some default credentials for backend and grafana
##### Grafana
- Username: admin
- Password: pass@123

##### Backend
- Username: admin
- Password: weakadmin

##### PostgreSQL database
- Username: admin
- Password: admin

### Running backend without docker locally
1. Clone the repository
2. Move into the project directory
3. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Modify the `.env` variables to match the ones in `.env-template`. You can  leave the database variables as they are if you wish to.
4. Modify the `lemonapi/utils/database.py` file section with `DB_URL` and modify the host part being after `@` sign to match your postgres host. You can leave the default values in `.env` as
   they are if you wish to In which case the database username will be `admin`, the password will be `admin` and database name will be set to `lemonapi`.
   You can also pass whole connection string there.
6. All variables should be now set. Run the project with `uvicorn lemonapi.main:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001 --log-level=info`
7. You should now be able access the api at `http://localhost:5001/docs` or `http://127.0.0.1:5001/docs`
